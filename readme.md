working link - https://kind-brattain-53f73d.netlify.app/dashboard/

A webApp that is a virtual Garage. Allows you to add vehicles, delete a vehicle and edit a vehicle.
Each vehicle has a - Make, Model,Year, Miles, Image and Services Section. The this can be editable , the user is recommened to keep adding services and the date so maintain a log of the services the car has recieved.

The web uses a user database for the signup/create user with JWT token Authentication To create personalized garages. The backend has a one to many relationship table to allow users to have their own separate garage


## Technolgies used
React, JSON, One to Many Relationships, HTML, CSS,
Router & Links
encrypted passwords and JWT token authorization
Netlify - Front end
Heroku - Backend


## Approach Taken
Created the components that I wanted to use and created folder structure
Created the Appstate to assure that data would be pulling from the fetch request
Strcutured components and forms in barebones left CSS and Styling for the last day after making sure JSON data would be returned
wanted image backgrounds to go as a closed garage to an opened garage when you log in

## Difficulties
JWT tokens,- Trial and error as this was the first time I had used JWT tokesn.
Importing components and App state and knowing what I would have to destrcture and re use in the different components.

 ## Future Improvements

Better Displaying for the vehicle, and mobile ready, right now the webbAPp is only  browser ready , I would need to add meqia querys to efficently structure the sizing and placement
